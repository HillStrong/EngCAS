# EngCAS
This repository will be a modification of FriCAS/Axiom. This is a rewrite of FriCAS/Axiom by changing the updating the FriCAS/Axiom language. It is intended that the new language be implemented on alternative implementation languages such as C, Unicon, Python or Scheme instead of the current Common Lisp base as used in FriCAS/Axiom.

The baisc reason is that the current FriCAS/Axiom language has a number of imprecisions in the language.
