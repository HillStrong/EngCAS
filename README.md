# EngCAS
This repository will be a modification of FriCAS/Axiom. This is a rewrite of FriCAS/Axiom by changing the updating the FriCAS/Axiom language. It is intended that the new language be implemented on alternative implementation languages such as C, Unicon, Python or Scheme instead of the current Common Lisp base as used in FriCAS/Axiom.

The baisc reason is that the current FriCAS/Axiom language has a number of imprecisions in the language.

I am expecting this to take up to 5 years to develop the required language, denotational semantics, compiler and update the lirary files. 

The main requirement is that corresponding code in the new language give the same results as would be found in FriCAS/Axiom.

Whether or not this project is of interest to anyone else, I am in effective retirement and have some longer term goals for this new project.
